### Analytics

This website uses Libre Counter, a privacy-friendly analytics tool, to count unique visitors. Here's what you need to know:

- No personal data is collected or stored.
- The counter is not visible on the site.
- We only track the number of unique visitors, not individual browsing behavior.
- No cookies are used for this purpose.

For more information about Libre Counter, visit [their website](https://librecounter.org/).

### Implementation

The Libre Counter is implemented using the following HTML tag, placed at the end of each page:

```html
<img src="https://librecounter.org/unique.svg" referrerPolicy="unsafe-url" width="0" alt="" />
```

This implementation:
- Counts unique visitors (with a 30-minute window between counts for the same user)
- Does not display anything visible on the page
- Respects user privacy by not using cookies or collecting personal data

### Data Usage

The visitor count data is used solely to understand the general usage of our site. We do not use this data for any other purpose, nor do we share it with third parties.
